## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ML_Timeline
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate Visualizations

Run the calendar generation script:
```bash
python scripts/generate_calendar.py
```

This will create the following files in the `output/` directory:
- `conference_gantt_chart.png` - Timeline visualization showing submission and conference periods
- `conference_calendar.png` - Monthly calendar view with color-coded deadlines
- `conference_timeline.md` - Detailed markdown timeline with all conference information

## Data Format

Conference data is stored in YAML format. Each conference entry includes:

```yaml
- name: "Conference Full Name"
  acronym: "CONF"
  category: "tier1"  # tier1, tier2, or workshop
  timeline:
    full_paper:
      submission_deadline: "2026-MM-DD"

    workshop_short_paper:
      submission_deadline: "2026-MM-DD"
      notification: "2026-MM-DD"
    conference_dates:

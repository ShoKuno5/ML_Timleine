## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**

The user reported that most conference URLs were inaccessible, which completely undermined the credibility enhancements we had built. This report documents the comprehensive debugging and solution implemented.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Primary Issues Found:**
1. **Broken Year-Specific Domains**: URLs like `ijcai25.org` were non-existent (ENOTFOUND errors)
